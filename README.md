# NoTrAmp
Normalization and Trimming of long-read (ONT, PB) amplicon sequencing data


NoTrAmp is a Tool for read-depth normalization and trimming of amplicon reads generated with long read technologies (ONT/PacBio).
It can be used in amplicon-tiling approaches to cap coverage of each amplicon and to trim amplicons to their
appropriate length removing barcodes, adpaters and primers (if desired) in a single clipping step.
